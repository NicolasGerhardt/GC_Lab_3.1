# GC_Lab_3.1
## Task
Provide information about students in the class.

## What will the application do?
* Provide information about students in a class
* Prompt the user to ask about a particular student
* Give proper responses according to user-submitted information
* Ask if user would like to learn about another student

## Build Specifications/Grading Points
* Create 3 arrays and fill them with student information—one with name, one with favorite food, one with previous title (2 points total)
* Ask the user which student they want to know about and take input (1 point)
* Convert the input to an integer (1 point)
* Make sure the input is within range for your arrays (1 point)
* Prompt for corrected input if it’s not an integer or out of range (1 point)
* Ask the user whether they want favorite candy or previous title and take input (1 point)
* Prompt again if they entered a category that doesn’t exist (1 point)
* Display the relevant information (1 point)
* As if the user would like to learn about another student, take input, and loop back if they do (1 point)

## Extended Challenges
* Ask if the user would like to learn more about the current student, find out about another, or quit. Provide the other piece of information (candy or title) if they want to learn more
* Provide an option where the user can see a list of all students
* Make the input for information category fault tolerant—take multiple relevant inputs for each category or just check if it contains “candy” or “title” instead of being a complete match
